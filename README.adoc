= ocaml-llvm
llvm bindings for OCaml (Bazelized)

WARNING: Experimental. Used solely for developing a Bazel
build of the bindings.

This is not a fork; the source in this repo was _copied_ from the
link:https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/llvm/bindings/ocaml[llvm-project],
so it is not kept up to date. The subdirectories of
`llvm/bindings/ocaml` are under `src/`.

NOTE: Status as of Sept 22, 2023: each subdir in `src/` has a
`BUILD.bazel` file; most targets build on MacOS 13.5.2. Not tested on
Linux yet.  **Will not work for you** - the build depends
on the configuration of my local workstation, because some of the
elements (such as Bazel/OPAM integration) involved are still under
development. I expect to publish the stuff in the next few weeks, at
which point I'll add more detailed information here; until then,
you'll have to settle for reading the (Bazel) code, which fortunately
is very simple.

== notes

The OCaml module in `src/backends` does not build, because it depends
on CMake `configure_file` processing that I have not ported yet.

The llvm toolchain
(link:https://github.com/grailbio/bazel-toolchain[grailbio/bazel-toolchain])
works automagically - no need to download, install, configure. Bazel
handles all that automatically.

However, it did not work out of the box for this project, because it
is C++-centric. That is, Bazel made it available, but it is not
configured for C development. So I had to tweak it to expose the C
headers in `llvm/include/llvm-c`; fortunately this was very simple
(though admittedly it would be a show-stopper for somebody unfamiliar
with Bazel).

The META stuff is ignored. That's all about OPAM installation, which
will be handled by Bazel in its own way. For now the goal is just to build the stuff.

== testing

No testsuite atm, only a simple build test targets that verify the builds succeed:

    $ bazel test test

(in `test/BUILD.bazel`)

is a Bazel module that constructs Bazel toolchains for pre-compiled
llvm compilers (which it downloads).  This is what is used by this repo.

The link:https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main[llvm-project]
supports Bazel builds via unofficial Bazel code at

I have not worked with this.

project, superceded by the above, but possibly still of interest.
